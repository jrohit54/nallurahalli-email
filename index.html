<a href="mailto:us2dpar-js@karnataka.gov.in,k.chaturvedi@gov.in?subject=Urgent Appeal for Immediate Civic Attention in Nallurahalli, Whitefield, Bengaluru&body=Respected Chief Minister / Deputy Chief Minister,

We, the residents of Nallurahalli (Pincode 560066), Whitefield, Bengaluru, humbly bring to your attention the severe civic issues faced by our community. Despite paying significant taxes annually (Income Tax, GST, STT etc.), basic amenities in our area are completely neglected.

Unfortunately, neither our MP Shri P.C. Mohan (BJP) nor our MLA Shri Aravind Limbavali have visited our locality or shown concern for the deteriorating conditions.

Major Problems We Are Facing:
- Absence of proper footpaths — making walking unsafe for the public.
- Garbage and open drainage everywhere — leading to unbearable bad smells and increased health risks.
- Roads filled with large potholes — causing accidents and injuries.
- Multiple power cuts daily (5-8 times) — disrupting daily life severely.
- Extremely poor lake maintenance — lakes are in hazardous condition.
- Unchecked encroachments and open vacant plots left unattended.

We feel we are living in an environment that poses far greater health hazards than even the pandemic.

We sincerely request:
- Immediate inspection of the area by your personal representative/secretary.
- Strict action against those dumping garbage illegally.
- Construction of proper footpaths for safe pedestrian movement.
- Immediate removal of unauthorized encroachments.
- Cleaning and proper maintenance of open plots and lakes.

Important Note:
Most of these actions require only strong governance and enforcement, not additional funding.

We are hopeful for your urgent intervention to restore basic living conditions in our area and uphold the dignity of Bengaluru city.

Kindly treat this matter as extremely urgent.

Thanking you,
Residents of Nallurahalli, Whitefield, Bengaluru - 560066
